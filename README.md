# Docker-Compose Solutions for MQTT to PostgreSQL and LoRaWAN Network Server

This repository contains sample scripts demonstrating two Docker-Compose solutions. The first solution deploys two custom containers that run a Python script subscribing to an MQTT broker and inserting the payload into a SQL table on a PostgreSQL database. The second solution, located in the `lorawan-network-server-deploy` subfolder, contains reference files based on the Docker deploy instructions for The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Docker-Compose solutions on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Python 3.11.x
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Build and run the Docker-Compose solutions:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Usage

### MQTT to PostgreSQL

1. Ensure your MQTT broker is running and accessible.
2. The Python script in the first Docker-Compose solution will subscribe to the MQTT broker and insert the received payloads into the PostgreSQL database.

### LoRaWAN Network Server

1. Navigate to the `lorawan-network-server-deploy` subfolder:
    ```sh
    cd lorawan-network-server-deploy
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the reference files to deploy The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server.
